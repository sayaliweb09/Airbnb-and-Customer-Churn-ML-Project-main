# Airbnb Price Prediction & Customer Churn Prediction 📊

## 📑 Project Overview

This repository contains two **Machine Learning Projects**:  
1️⃣ **Airbnb Price Prediction** — A regression project predicting the price of Airbnb listings based on features like property type, room type, location, amenities, and host details.  
2️⃣ **Customer Churn Prediction** — A classification project predicting whether a customer will churn based on demographic, account, and service-related data.

## ✅ Project 1: Airbnb Price Prediction
### Goal  
Build a **regression model** to predict the price of Airbnb listings and provide insights to hosts for better pricing strategies.

### Techniques Used  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (e.g., neighborhood popularity score, amenities count)
- Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Evaluation Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²
- Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

### Key Insights  
- Amenities, room type, and location heavily influence price.
- XGBoost performed the best with **R² = 0.56**.
- Popular neighborhoods command higher prices.

## ✅ Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction
### Goal  
Build a **classification model** to predict whether a telecom customer will churn based on their account, service, and demographic data.

### Techniques Used  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering & Encoding
- Classification Model: Random Forest (with GridSearch Tuning)
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib

### Key Insights  
- High monthly charges and low tenure are strong churn indicators.
- Fiber optic users churn more than DSL users.
- Customers paying via **Electronic Check** have higher churn rates.

## 📢 Recommendations (Key Takeaways for Businesses)

### For Airbnb Hosts
- Focus on **amenities, location, and host responsiveness** to increase price.
- Improve reviews to enhance neighborhood reputation.

### For Telecom Companies
- Target customers with high monthly charges and low tenure for loyalty offers.
- Encourage automatic payments to reduce churn risk.
- Focus retention campaigns on fiber optic users who are more likely to churn.
